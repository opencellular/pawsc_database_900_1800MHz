1) filemon.sh: monitor directory for *.db file uploads. Currently on one directory is monitored -chkdirdb(). The others have to meaninful logic in them.

2)querydb.sh: gets called by filemon.sh whenever *.db file land in directory being watched. filemon.sh passes *.db filename to querydb.sh. querydb.sh interrogates the db to farm out the data needed to generate graph. The output of querydb.sh get directed to tmp/spec_map.txt, a text file used by spemap.sh to plot spectrum map.

3) specmap.sh: gets called by querydb.sh when it finishes its thing.
