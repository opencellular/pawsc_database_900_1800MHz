RfTrack Android Application
===========================

 Rftrack is an Android application that interfaces to RfExplorer, low-cost portable spectrum analyzers. It collects data from the spectrum analyzer, transforming tablet or Android smartphones in low cost / low power monitoring systems of TV White Spaces (TVWS) frequencies.

Data collected by RTfTrack can be sent via email to a remote server, which analyzes them and generate reports available at this web address:

In various countries, with the transition from analogue to digital terrestrial television, a large portion of the frequencies previously occupied by analog channels have been left partially empty (TVWS TV White Spaces).

For example, these frequencies can be used to provide broadband network or other services in rural, marginal and isolated areas.

After several monitoring campaigns performed worldwide to measure the spectrum occupation, was concluded that:

1. Most of the spectrum is underused.

2. To evaluate the real occupation, are necessary additional measurements at different locations,  performed for longer times.

3. costs (for equipment) and the time required to perform measurements have a strong impact on the implementation of the measuring campaigns.
